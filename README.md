# Python Flask WSGI skeleton

This example shows how to create a WSGI Flask server with routes splitted into separate files. In this example I made
the routes into separate files to show case how that can be done. Also I included some example class file to show how
to make use of it into your routes, get app data into blueprint routes and so on..

## Features:

- routes in separate files
- threaded flask application so the main program can do something else
- Show case of class files imported into routes
- Show case of configuration parameters shared across the program
- Show case of templates
- Show case of static files
- Show case of sse (server side events)
- Show case of single page web application
- Show case of howto get app parameters in blueprint routes available
- Show case of flask template rendering
- Show case of base template
- Show case of javascript and flask
- Bootstrap
- howto keep your source code tidy in nice directories
- gevent sleep to keep flask responsive during high output

## Why???

Most examples are either highly detailed on a certain aspect of Flask/WSGI or to simple. It serves as a jumpstart into
a project. 

## Usage

    pip install -r requirements.txt
